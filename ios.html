            <br/><br/>One of the main iOS 11 features in the new Control Center. It has been changed yet again,
            <br/>and now has a fullscreen design. The screen brightness and sound sliders now have <br/> a new position
            under the new media controls. Majority of the new buttons can be 3D Touched, <br/> or on devices without 3D 
            Touch, long hold. Something very unexpected was the introduction <br/> of a screen recorder, as this is something 
            Apple has seemed to be against for many years. <br/>There is also an Apple TV remote built into the Control
            Center, for those who wish <br/> to use it. Finally, the Control Center is customisable! You can add or remove certain
            toggles <br/> in the Control Center, if you wish.
