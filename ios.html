        <h1>iOS 11 is coming in a few months. Get Ready.</h1>
        <p>
            iOS 11 will be here in a few months, so lets cover the new main features!
        </p>

            <br/><br/>One of the main iOS 11 features in the new Control Center. It has been changed yet again,
            <br/>and now has a fullscreen design. The screen brightness and sound sliders now have <br/> a new position
            under the new media controls. Majority of the new buttons can be 3D Touched, <br/> or on devices without 3D 
            Touch, long hold. Something very unexpected was the introduction <br/> of a screen recorder, as this is something 
            Apple has seemed to be against for many years. <br/>There is also an Apple TV remote built into the Control
            Center, for those who wish <br/> to use it. Finally, the Control Center is customisable! You can add or remove certain
            toggles <br/> in the Control Center, if you wish.  
        </p>

        <p id="AppStore">
            <br/><br/>Another new feature is the redesigned App Store. The <br/> App Store now has has a new 'Today' tab, which shows stories about
            how to<br/> use certain apps, as well as 'App of the Week' and so on. <br/>Buttons and text are bigger than before, so it makes things easier to use. <br/> Overall, the new App Store looks and feels better and it is <br/> more user friendly as well.

            There are also a range of new icons in iOS 11. The App Store <br/> has a new icon, with the App Store logo the center of it. <br/> The iTunes Store also has a new icon, which <br/> is a star. Apple completely ditched the old logo, whereas in the <br/> App Store, there are some similarities. The Contacts app <br/> also has a new icon, which, in my opinion, looks a lot <br/> better. Finally, the Calculator and Reminders have new icons, <br/> with the Calculator icon reflecting the new interface, and the <br/> Reminders icon has been slightly tweaked.
