        The original iPhone was a breakthrough in the mobile phone industry. Being able to touch the screen and <br/> interact with content was incredible for its time. This was made better because Apple implemented Multi-Touch into the <br/> display, allowing you too use multiple fingers on the display at one time.

        The phone came preloaded with iPhone OS 1, and it didn't even come with the App Store. The App Store <br/> was launched alongside the iPhone 3G in 2008. Although, the original iPhone did get an update to get the App Store. Users <br/> of any phone had never had access to a store where they could download apps, and Apple opened this up to the world. <br/>

        When the iPhone was released, it became apparant that it was super locked-down compared to the soon-to-be-released Android. Along with <br/> this came the Jailbreak community, a group of people who cracked iPhone OS so they could install their own <br/> software. Along with Jailbreaking came Cydia, created by Jay Freeman (Saurik), a app that allows all users <br/> to easily install Jailbreak tweaks.
