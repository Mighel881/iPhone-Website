        The original iPhone was a breakthrough in the mobile phone industry. Being able to touch the screen and interact with <br/> content was incredible for its time, however Apple chose to innovate even more and incorporated Multi-Touch into the <br/> display. This allowed you too use multiple fingers on the display at one time.

        <p id="AppStore">
        The phone came preloaded with iPhone OS 1, but didn't include the App Store. The App Store <br/> was launched alongside the iPhone 3G in 2008. The original iPhone recieved an update a few days later <br/> that included the App Store. Users of any phone had never had access to a store where they could download apps, and <br/> Apple opened this up to the world.

        When the iPhone was released, it became apparant that it was super locked-down compared to the soon-to-be-released Android. As a result, <br/> the jailbreak community started, a group of people who cracked iPhone OS (and later on, iOS) so they could <br/> install their own software. Along with Jailbreaking came Cydia, created by Jay Freeman (Saurik), an app that <br/> allows all users to easily install Jailbreak tweaks.
