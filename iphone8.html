        One of the biggest selling point, like many iPhones before it, will be the camera. Unlike the iPhone 7's horizontal camera, <br/> Apple has now made it vertical. This has something to do with the new ARKit that Apple has launched with the iOS 11 beta. <br/> It is also rumoured that the iPhone 8 will be able to shoot 4K at 60 FPS, which is a feature only available in top-end cameras right now.

        The biggest feature of the iPhone is the edge-to-edge display. The display will now have virtually no bezels, apart from a <br/> small cutout at the top. The cutout will have the front-facing camera, as well as the proximity sensor and the new infared <br/> sensor. The infared sensor will be used with Face ID (or at least that is its rumoured name), which will used <br/> as well as (or instead of) Touch ID. It can also be used with Apple Pay.

        Previous versions of the iPhone haven't changed much when it comes to the size of the screen and the body shape, which means <br/> iOS can't be tailored well to the latest phone. But becuase the iPhone 8 is is ditching the home button, then iOS 11 <br/> will have to be tailored to it more. Rumour has it that there will be a function bar which may include a virtual <br/> home button. iOS 11 will run faster on the new A11 chip as well, but this is the same as previous iPhones with their first iOS version.
