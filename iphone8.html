        One of the biggest selling point, like many iPhones before it, will be the camera. Unlike the iPhone 7's horizontal camera, <br/> Apple has now made it vertical. This has something to do with the new ARKit that Apple has launched with the iOS 11 beta. <br/> It is also rumoured that the iPhone 8 will be able to shoot 4K at 60 FPS, which is a feature only available in top-end cameras right now.

        The biggest feature of the iPhone is the edge-to-edge display. The display will now have virtually no bezels, apart from a <br/> small cutout at the top. The cutout will have the front-facing camera, as well as the proximity sensor and the new infared <br/> sensor. The infared sensor will be used with Face ID (or at least that is its rumoured name), which will used <br/> as well as Touch ID. It can also be used with Apple Pay.
