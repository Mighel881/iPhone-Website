        Cybersafety is a big problem in todays society, with the rise of the internet and social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. <br/> Snapchat is especially popular with teens and young adults, as it allows people to share photos that 'disappear' soon after they are posted.<br/> However, these photos 'disappear', cyberbullies see this as a way to attack people without it getting caught. Other social media sites such as Kik have been<br/> critisized because anyone can chat with anyone.<br/><br/> Facebook is known for taking away your privacy. The site will try and obtain as much infomation from you as possible. <br/> There are settings that you can change to prevent Facebook from using some of this infomation, but not all of it. Facebook was <br/> known to use your location to suggest people to follow. It never seeked users permission to do this, which made many <br/> users very angry. Facebook did confess and apologise, but not after denying that they ever did it. Finally, you can no longer <br/> create a profile that is completely private, as that toggle has been removed. Anyone can search you up on Facebook and find your profile.
