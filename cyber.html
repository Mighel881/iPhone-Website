        Cybersafety is a bug problem in todays society, with the rise of the internet and social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. <br/> Snapchat is especially popular with teens and young adults, as it allows people to share photos that 'disappear' soon after they are posted.<br/> However, because these photos 'disappear', cyberbullies see this as a way to attack people without it getting caught. Other social media sites such as Kik have been<br/> critisized because anyone can chat with anyone.<br/><br/> Facebook is terrible when it comes to your privacy. They will try and take as much infomation about you as possible. There are <br/> settings that you can change to stop Facebook from taking some of this info, but not all of it. Facebook has been known to use your location to suggest friends <br/> which many people were angry about it. It also never asked users permission to do this, which isnt allowed. Facebook did confess and apoligise, but not after denying that <br/> they ever did it. Finally, you can no longer create your profile completely private, as that toggle has been removed. Anyone can search you up on Facebook and find your profile. <br/>
